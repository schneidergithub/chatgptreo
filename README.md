# chatgptreo - automatically generated repo
Testing

This repo is an artifact created automatically from running the PMAC bootstrapper. It used chatGPT4o to build the bash script from a file of chat prompts in JSON format.  The JSON file is TDD Gherkin user stories, that builds a shell script to create github repos from command line.  The final step is verifying this repo is created. 

PASSED: Acceptance Criteria is a SUCCESS.
